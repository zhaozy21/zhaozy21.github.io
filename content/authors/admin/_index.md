Hello! My name is Ziyan Zhao. I am currently pursuing a direct Ph.D. program in Mechatronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. I completed my undergraduate studies at the Department Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, in 2021.

My research interests include intelligent control, robotics, and motor-driving mechanisms. I am particularly skilled in hands-on creation, with exceptional abilities in circuitry and hardware design. I enjoy crafting innovative and geeky products in practical.

Beyond academia, I also like outdoor activities, including cycling, mountain climbing, and hiking. These pursuits fuel my creativity and physical well-being.
