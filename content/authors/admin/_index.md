Hello! My name is Ziyan Zhao. I am currently pursuing a direct Ph.D. program in Mechatronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. I completed my undergraduate studies at the Department Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, in 2021.

My research background is in motor drive and control, and I am now expanding my focus to intelligent robotics, particularly reinforcement learning-based control. I combine theoretical foundations with hands-on expertise in controller design and system integration. I am passionate about developing innovative solutions at the intersection of classical control and modern AI techniques.

Beyond my technical work, I enjoy outdoor activities like cycling, swimming and hiking, which help maintain my creative thinking and problem-solving abilities.
