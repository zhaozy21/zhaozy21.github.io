As an annual highlight at Tsinghua University since 1997, the Agent Competition has reached its 28th edition. This contest involves a two-player adversarial game where participants submit their AI codes to [**Saiblo**](https://www.saiblo.net/), an AI online battle platform developed by the Student Association of Science and Technology (SAST). Competitors must defeat their opponents in the game to win. During the competition, each participant is challenged to write thousands of lines of AI code and engage in hundreds of test battles over a two-month period. The competition is a test of programming skills, strategic thinking, and persistence in the contest. **Ziyan Zhao achieves the second place among over a hundred participants in the 26th THUAC.**

The 26th Tsinghua University Agent Competition (THUAC 26), featuring the game "[SnakeGo](https://docs.saiblo.net/games/snake-go/snake-go.html)", is a strategic contest where intelligent agents control snakes on a 16x16 grid. Each player (agent) starts with a single snake, and the game involves turns where agents can move, split their snake, or use special items. The objective is to cover the most area with the snakes and the walls they create. Agents need to be adept at strategy, anticipating opponent moves, and utilizing items effectively. The game challenges agents' decision-making skills, tactical planning, and adaptability in a dynamic environment.
