## My Project Involvement
During my internship at Mech-Mind, I was an integral part in innovating the hardware design of **structured light scanning systems**. My role involved hands-on work with structured light cameras, where I contributed to replacing traditional high-precision, costly galvanometer motors with more compact and economical stepper motors.

## Why Stepper Motors?
The decision to use stepper motors is strategic. These motors are not only cost-effective but also offer high reliability and ease of maintenance. The main challenge is to maintain the scanning accuracy, which is crucial in 3D vision applications. To address this, we employ advanced control algorithms and compensation techniques, ensuring that the precision of the structured light scanning system remains within acceptable limits.

## Achieved Outcomes and Metrics
The project was a success, meeting its key goals and metrics. By integrating stepper motors, we significantly reduced the hardware costs without compromising on the system's performance. The accuracy of the scanning system was maintained within the required standards, proving the efficacy of our algorithms.
