🎹 Introducing the "Piano Rhythm Game Machine" – where Beethoven meets the 21st Century in a symphony of tech and tunes! 🎶

Imagine a piano that doesn't just make music but also plays games with you. That's right, our project ingeniously melds a custom-made digital piano with a dazzling dot matrix screen, creating a waterfall of notes that guide your fingers to musical mastery.

Crafted with the magic of Arduino, STM32, and other development tools, this standalone music machine is a perfect duet of fun and education. It's like having a patient piano teacher who never yells, right in your living room!

Here's the score:

- A vibrant 7-color LED dot matrix display that turns learning notes into a game of colorful falling stars.
- Custom-designed (3D printed) piano keys that feel so real. ~~You might check if they're made from ebony and ivory. (?)~~
- Meticulously tuned with **DAC** analog waveform fitting. ~~Giving you a sound so authentic, you'll think Mozart just stopped by~~.
- On-screen key assistance to guide your play – because who doesn't appreciate a little help now and then?
- A library of up to a million melodies all stored on a single SD card – ~~who needs Spotify when you have this?~~
- Say goodbye to traditional rhythm games and hello to an authentic musical experience. With its minimalist design, it's not just a piano; it's a piece of art, showcasing the beauty of craftsmanship.

Get ready to tickle the ivories and let the games begin! 🕹️🎶
